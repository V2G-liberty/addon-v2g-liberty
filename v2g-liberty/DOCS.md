# V2G Liberty add-on

The V2G Liberty add-on delivers full automatic and optimised control over bidirectional charging 
of your electric vehicle (EV). Bidirectional charging is also known as Vehicle to Grid (V2G).

*Liberty* in the name refers to:
- V2G&nbsp;Liberty strives for you to be independent of the make/type of charger & car.
 
  <span class="sub-text">The truth now is that only the Wallbox Quasar charger offers (affordable) bidirectional charging.
  As it is equipped with a CHAdeMo connector, so currently only cars with this connector are supported.
  We expect to add new chargers to V2G&nbsp;Liberty soon.</span>
- V2G&nbsp;Liberty strives for you to be independent of power company.
 
  <span class="sub-text">You can choose any contract but V2G is only relevant for contracts with dynamic 
  (e.g. hourly changing) electricity prices.</span>

You can read more about V2G Liberty on [v2g-liberty.eu](https://v2g-liberty.eu/) or [github.com](https://github.com/V2G-liberty/addon-v2g-liberty)

The schedules are optimised to maximise revenues. The optimised schedules
are produced by [FlexMeasures](https://flexmeasures.io/). While the price optimisation already 
decreases emissions significantly, you can also choose to take sustainability a step further and optimise for minimising emissions (and still do quite well on savings on charge costs).


## Preparation

Before installing or activation of V2G Liberty, please make sure:
 - The charging and discharging with the EV and Quasar charger works properly. Test this with the app supplied with the charger.
 - You have a FlexMeasures account
 - You have an electricity contract with dynamic prices (can be added later)
 - You have an online calendar

For details see [readme on GitHub](https://github.com/V2G-liberty/addon-v2g-liberty?tab=readme-ov-file#Preparation).


## Installation 

The installation of this add-on is pretty straightforward and only needs to be done once.
Later updates will install automatically.

As you see this text in the add-on UI you've probably already 
completed steps 1 to 7, if so, skip them.

1. Copy this URL: `https://github.com/V2G-liberty/addon-v2g-liberty.git`
2. In home assistant got to `settings > add-ons`.
3. Hit the big blue button in the bottom right `add-on shop`.
4. Open the menu in the top right with the ‚ãÆ-icon and select the option `repostitories`.
5. Paste the URL of step 1 and click `ADD`, wait a little and click `Close`.
6. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, the V2G Liberty add-on should be visible there.
   If not, refresh the page. Click the add-on.
7. The add-on page opens, click the `Install` button to install the add-on. This might take 
   quite a while as several files have to be copied.
8. Consider activating `Watch dog` and `Automatic update`.
9. Click `Start` to get the V2G Liberty add-on going.<br>
   Have a look at the logs (most right tab on top of the page) to see if all went well.
   The last line should say something like:

   `s6-rc: info: service legacy-services successfully started`.


Now the add-on needs to be configured before finishing the installation.


## Configuration

If you've upgraded from an earlier version of V2G Liberty (also with the manual installation) you can normally 
skip the configuration steps.

You'll need to edit some .yaml files, here we use the File Editor add-on, you can use another one if you prefer.

1. Start the File Editor add-on `settings > add-ons > File Editor`. 
2. Open `v2g_liberty_example_configuration.yaml` and paste this text:
   ```yaml
   homeassistant:
     packages:
       v2g_pack: !include packages/v2g_liberty/v2g_liberty_package.yaml

   # Loads default set of integrations. Do not remove.
   default_config:
   ```
    - If there is a section `homeassistant:` already, just add the lines `packages: ... .yaml` in there.
    - If there is a section `default_config:` already, leave it unchanged.

   Don't forget to save your changes.

3. Now restart Home Assistant by going to `settings > system` and in the top 
   right click the top right ‚èº menu and select `Restart Home Assistant`.

4. When the restart finished the *V2G&nbsp;Liberty* menu item in the left menu should be visible, open this by clicking it.
5. The UI shows but more configuration is needed, so go to the settings tab. 
6. Review all sections of the page and complete the requested information as necessary.

## Tips & tricks

Make your V2G life even more enjoyable!
These are "out of the box" super handy Home Assistant features. These settings are optional but highly recommended.


### Add additional users

You can get it from the official app store of your phone platform.
If you‚Äôve added your HA instance and logged in you can manage the charging via the app and, 
very conveniently, receive notifications about the charging on you mobile.


### Make V2G Liberty your default dashboard

To make the V2G Liberty dashboard your default go to `Settings > Dashboards`. 
Select the V2G Liberty dashboard row and click the link "SET AS DEFAULT IN THIS DEVICE".
