# V2G&nbsp;Liberty tests directory

This directory holds copies of the modules that have test data in them. The alterations are marked with 
```##### TESTDATA #####```

Ofcourse this is a bit clumsy but it at least retains the tests that have been developed for each module.

This should become the directory with automated unit-tests.
