### V2G Liberty constants ###

# Date 2024-04-05 Bug fix, version here needs to be complient with config.yaml and changelog.md
V2G_LIBERTY_VERSION = "0.0.2"

# USER PREFERENCE
# See remark for charger constants
# Battery protection boundaries ##
# A hard setting that is always respected (and used for Max_Charge_Now when
# car is connected with a SoC below this value)
# Defaults to 20 (to be safe)
CAR_MIN_SOC_IN_PERCENT: int = 20
# Derived from above setting and CAR_MAX_CAPACITY_IN_KWH
CAR_MIN_SOC_IN_KWH: float

# A 'soft' setting, that is respected during normal cycling but is ignored when
# a calendar item requires a higher SoC.
# Defaults to 80% (to be safe)
CAR_MAX_SOC_IN_PERCENT: int = 80
# Derived from above setting and CAR_MAX_CAPACITY_IN_KWH
CAR_MAX_SOC_IN_KWH: float

# Duration in hours, defaults to 12 should be between 2 and 36 hours
ALLOWED_DURATION_ABOVE_MAX_SOC: int = 12

# Utility context
# The utility (or electricity provider) are represented by different sensor's.
# These sensor's determine to which signal the schedules are optimised.
# These are the also used for fetching data from FM to show in the graph.
# ToDo: Add EPEX NO and Emissions NO sensors
